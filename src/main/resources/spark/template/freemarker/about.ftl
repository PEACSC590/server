                <h3> Here at PEAbay, our goal is to provide Exeter students with a means to buy and sell their belongings to other students at the Academy.</h3>
                <p>PEABay was created, in part, to combat the high prices of the Phillips Exeter Bookstore.  The bookstore typically buys back books at significantly lower prices and sells them back as “Used” at a large fraction of the original price.
                Students may already have the same books other students need for their classes and will be willing to “cut out the middleman” (i.e. the bookstore).  In doing this, the book sellers will be able to receive more money for their books, while the buyers will be able to spend less money on the book.</p>
 
 <p>PEAbay is not just limited to books, however.  Students may also sell clothes, furniture, or other belongings that are no longer useful to them, but could be potentially useful to another student.</p>
 <p>PEAbay will only be useable by Exeter students and faculty, and we expect to have the majority of Exonians use the app for at least one transaction.</p>
